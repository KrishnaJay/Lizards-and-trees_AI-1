Project description

You are a zookeeper in the reptile house. One of your rare South Pacific Tufted Wizzo lizards
(Tufticus Wizzocus) has just had several babies. Your job is to find a place to put each baby lizard
in a nursery.
However, there is a catch, the baby lizards have very long tongues. A baby lizard can shoot out
its tongue and eat any other baby lizard before you have time to save it. As such, you want to
make sure that no baby lizard can eat another baby lizard in the nursery (burp).
For each baby lizard, you can place them in one spot on a grid. From there, they can shoot out
their tongue up, down, left, right and diagonally as well. Their tongues are very long and can
reach to the edge of the nursery from any location.
